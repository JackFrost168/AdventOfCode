## About Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a programming competition in December every year. It' very interesting and attractive. You can use your programming skill to solve the puzzles. And there is no limitation on programming languages. 

**One programming puzzle a day** is released at **EST/UTC-5 from 1st to 25th December**. The puzzle in each day divides into two parts and the second part unlocks after you solved the first part. You can compete with other programmers. The sooner the problem is solved, the better.

## About this repo
I discovered Advent of Code in 2018, and started to play until now. It's like a kind of **game**, after you solved the puzzles, you can move forward. it's a good way to improve **programming skills** and **problem solving skills**. In this repository you can find my solutions (some solutions are learned from some genius). 

Here is some private leaderboard and you can compete with others.
